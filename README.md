# Unhandled Exception in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: unhandled exceptions. The `bug.dart` file contains code that throws an exception if a negative value is assigned. However, the `main` function does not include any exception handling, causing the program to terminate abruptly.

The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to properly handle this exception using a `try-catch` block.
